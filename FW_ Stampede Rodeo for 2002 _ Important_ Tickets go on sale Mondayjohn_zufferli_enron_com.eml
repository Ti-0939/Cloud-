July 7th - 16th are the dates for 2002 Stampede

Tickets for the 2002 Stampede Rodeo go on sale Monday, August 20 through Ticket Master.  I am enquiring how may tickets we would like.  Eric talked about possibly sitting in the Infield seats for our customer event or renting a suite.  Suites will not be determined until the beginning of 2002 once the major corporate sponsors have decided on if they wish to lease the suite for the day.  If you could please try to get back to me by Wednesday with ticket numbers.  I will order tickets on Monday when Ticket Master opens.  

Infield apx $55
Regular Rodeo Seating apx $32

Suite cost about - 
Super Suite - 2001 prices
Rodeo Only includes 50 suite tickets for Afternoon Rodeo only
July 6-13	$13,520	
July 14-15	$14,870	
Chuckwagons Only includes 50 suite tickets for Chuckwagon Races only
July 6-13	$6,760	
July 14-15	$7,435	


Thanks for your request for information on the Calgary Stampede's Infield
Suites.  The Stampede's inventory of Infield Suites for the entire 10 days
of Stampede are held by our major corporate sponsors who have licensed the
suites as part of long-term contracts.

Each year, however, a very limited inventory of suites are offered back to
us from some of our 10-day suiteholders in "whole-day packages" -- what that
means is we receive back both the rodeo performance and chuckwagon race
performance to be sold as a package.

This "return" of suite dates does not traditionally occur until the new
year, when the companies begin to firm up their plans for the upcoming
Stampede.  Until then we maintain a waiting list of companies wishing to
lease suites for a single day or days.

To be added to the wait list, I require a request in writing with all
company details and preferred dates for Infield Suite use.

Please let me know if you have any other questions, I would be happy to
assist.
